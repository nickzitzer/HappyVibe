# Analytics Setup for HappyVibe

## Overview

HappyVibe collects anonymous usage data to help improve the app. By default, analytics are sent to a placeholder PostHog account, but you can easily configure it to send data to **your own PostHog account**.

## Quick Setup

###1. Create a PostHog Account (Free)

1. Go to [https://posthog.com](https://posthog.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project called "HappyVibe"
4. Copy your **Project API Key** (starts with `phc_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add your PostHog API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your PostHog API key
VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

### 3. Rebuild the App

```bash
# Rebuild to include your new analytics configuration
npm run tauri build
```

That's it! Now all usage data will be sent to **your** PostHog account.

## What Data is Collected?

HappyVibe collects **anonymous** usage data only:

‚úÖ **Collected:**

   ```bash
   VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=your_key npm run tauri build
   ```
3. **Document privacy policy** in your distribution

```

Useful dashboards to create:

```
